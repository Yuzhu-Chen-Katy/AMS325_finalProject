# AMS325_finalProject
## Overview
This project, housed within the "325project" folder, focuses on the development and analysis of machine learning models for music genre classification.

## Dataset
data_2genre.csv: Dataset designed for binary prediction tasks.
data.csv and relabeled_data.csv: Datasets tailored for multiclass prediction involving 10 genres.

## Feature Analysis
feature analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook provides insights into the distribution, mean, and correlation of the music features employed in the classification models.

## Neural Network
neural_network.ipynb: Explores propagation methods for both binary and multiclass classification using neural networks.
logistic.ipynb: Demonstrates a use case for binary prediction, specifically classifying the pop and classical music, takes in 30 sec .mp3 files.

## Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine.ipynb: An initial attempt to enhance multiclass prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) methodology.
variable.ipynb: Another preliminary exploration focusing on variable adjustments for improved multiclass prediction.
## Final Model
FinalVersion.ipynb: Contains the final machine learning model with the highest accuracy achieved, along with additional visualizations for comprehensive analysis.
